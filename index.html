			<p class="intro">Welcome fans of The Kitten Lady! Here are some of my favorite photographs from Hannah's Instagram! I look up to her and I hope to one day make as much of an impact on the lives of our dear kitties as she has!</p>

Both are wearing camp counselor sashes, and the man is holding a cat stuffed animal. In the foreground is a display box of cat pins and there is an event tag in the upper righthand corner." height="400">

The Kitten Lady is holding her book, and behind them is a bookshelf filled with copies ready for signing." height="400">

			<img src="IMG_8406.jpeg"alt="A photograph of an excited little boy wearing a superhero costume and a beanie that reads “save kittens” holds a trap for the TNR program in one hand while flexing his other arm. He is outside and there are fall leaves and grass on the ground." height="400">

			<img src="IMG_8407.jpeg"alt="A photograph of The Kitten Lady wearing a hoodie, looking at the camera in mock exasperation as a tabby kitten’s tail gives her a mustache. It’s hind leg and tail stick out of the hood as it climbs on in." height="400">
			<p>Hannah, your mustache is growing a cat...</p>
